<br>

## 📌 Overview
<p> This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard for analyzing crime trends in Greater London, utilizing Microsoft SQL Server for data storage and management. The dashboard offers detailed insights and interactive analytics into crime distributions, temporal patterns, and geographical hotspots to support efficient data-driven decision-making in crime prevention and law enforcement. </p>

<p> The project consists of a SQL database for structured data storage, data processing and transformation to clean and prepare the dataset, and a Power BI dashboard that visualizes crime trends through maps, charts, and graphs. </p>

<p>🤝 This project was developed by a group of 4 first year undergraduates, as part of a university assignment for the BSc in Applied Data Science Communication degree program.</p>
